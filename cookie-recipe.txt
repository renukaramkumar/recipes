Cream together the butter and sugar.
Once blended, add the flour. Continue to mix together until mixture becomes a soft dough (it'll be crumb like at the beginning...keep mixing and it will turn to dough. If needed, add 1-2 Tablespoons of water).
Roll dough out onto a slightly floured surface until ¼ inch thick.
Cut into rounds and place on a parchment or Silpat lined baking sheet.
Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a pale, golden brown.
